Data Structures and Algorithms  
-------------------------------
[TODO]  

Data Structures
- 01 Linked Lists
    - Operations: insert, insertAfter, delete, deleteKey, printList, append, reverse
- 02 Stack
    - Operations: push, pop, top, isEmpty
- 03 Recursion  
    - return the recursive function (eg. fib), call recursive function in block code (inorder in tree)
- 04 Queue
    - enqueue, dequeue, top, isEmpty
- 05 Binary Tree
    - dfs (inorder, preorder, postorder), bfs
- 06 Binary Search Tree
    - insert, delete, search
- 07 Binary Heap
- 08 Graph
    - bfs, dfs, adjacency lists, addEdge, addNode


Algorithms
- 09 Quick Sort
- 10 Merge Sort
    - find median, split array into two
    - call merge sort into two halves 
    - merge all of them in the end (that's a different function and code)
- 11 Algorithms Problems
